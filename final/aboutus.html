            <div class="card-window2"><h1>History & Profile</h1><br>
                Cardinal Santos Medical Center (CSMC), formerly known as St. Paul’s Hospital of Manila, was originally founded by the Maryknoll Sisters before World War II. It was one of the many structures in the country destroyed by heavy artillery after the war. As part of a rebuilding program, the hospital was granted financial compensation by the US-Philippines War Damage Commission.
                Due to economic difficulties brought about by post-war inflation, the Roman Archdiocese of Manila (RCAM), headed by Archbishop Rufino Cardinal Santos, provided financial aid for the reconstruction of the hospital. On August 15, 1974, it began operation and was instituted as the Cardinal Santos Memorial Hospital in honor of the first Filipino Cardinal.

                <br><br>The hospital was renamed as Cardinal Santos Medical Center in August 1, 1988 and was entrusted into the hands of the Hospital Managers, Inc. (HMI), a private company which managed the hospital’s business operations for over two decades.

                <br><br>HMI turned over the hospital management to the Colinas Verdes Hospital Managers Corporation (CVHMC) which took over on August 15, 2008 under the leadership of Manuel “Manny” V. Pangilinan.

                <br><br>Under the new management team, CSMC has earned its place as one of the country’s leading hospitals specializing in the fields of Cardiology, Neurosurgery, Oncology, and Rehabilitation Medicine. It is also known for its expertise in Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pulmonary Medicine, Gastroenterology/Diagnostic and Advanced Therapeutic Endoscopy, Nephrology, Urology, and Minimally Invasive Surgery.</div>
